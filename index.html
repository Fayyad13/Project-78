        <h2>Project On Console</h2>
        <p>Visual Studio is a coding software which is easier to use than some other softwares. 
            First you download the software then you select which type of laptop you're using. Then you create a folder and use that folder on Visual Studio, create a file in the folder named index.html and code.</p>
            <p>The console screen is used for debugging among other things. You can open the console screen on any website by clicking on the screen with the right side of the touch pad or the right side of a mouse and then pressing console. You can print on the console screen by using console.log in your code.</p>
